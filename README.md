# Medical Coding AI: pre-bill coding and claim-integrity assistant

**Clinical note → evidence-backed ICD-10-CM diagnoses + CPT/HCPCS/ICD-10-PCS procedures → official-guideline citations → deterministic validation → calibrated confidence → coder approval → draft claim → pre-bill denial check (MUE, NCCI, modifiers, validity on the date of service...) → audited export.**

Real-world goal: fewer denials, less coder time per chart, fewer missed charges, and every code traceable to documentation and guidelines. See **[docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)** (problem, solution, results, KPIs, roadmap) and **[docs/DATA_SOURCES.md](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md)** (data you have, data missing, where to get it).

**Run it on Google Colab:** [colab/COLAB_COMMANDS.md](colab/COLAB_COMMANDS.md) / `colab/MedicalCodingAI_Colab.ipynb`.

The LLM never has the last word. Every suggestion is grounded in retrieved official reference text, checked by a rule engine that cannot hallucinate, scored by the platform (not by the model's self-reported confidence), and approved, edited or rejected by a human coder. Every step is versioned and written to a tamper-evident audit trail.

## What's in the box

| Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Ingestion | PDF (text layer), DOCX, TXT, magic-byte type detection, size limits, scanned-PDF detection with an OCR provider interface, text normalization, clinical section detection (SOAP, H&P, discharge summary, op note) |
| Clinical NLP | Curated lexicon (~390 terms, abbreviation-safe), problem-list parser with combination-diagnosis handling, **ConText/NegEx** assertion engine (negated, uncertain, historical, family, hypothetical), laterality/severity/temporal modifiers, optional LLM extraction reconciled against ConText (disagreements are flagged, never silently resolved) |
| Knowledge base | **Official CDC ICD-10-CM FY2026 tabular** (98,262 codes, 74,795 billable) with 7th-character expansion and inherited instructional notes (Excludes1/2, code first, use additional code). HCPCS Level II loader (CMS file). CPT loader gated behind an explicit AMA-license acknowledgement; no CPT content is shipped |
| RAG | Qdrant dense retrieval (local ONNX `bge-small-en-v1.5`, baked into the image) + in-process BM25, reciprocal rank fusion, coding-convention priors (NOS over NEC, chapter/episode guards) |
| LLM | OpenRouter, strict `json_schema` output, Pydantic validation with one repair round, retries with backoff, cost/token accounting, `data_collection: deny` provider routing, versioned prompts, optional second model for agreement scoring |
| Validation | Code exists (and in which version), billable, verbatim evidence (anti-hallucination), negation/uncertainty/family contradictions, NLP-vs-LLM assertion conflicts, Excludes1 conflicts, unspecified-with-specific, laterality mismatch, sex/age edits, manifestation sequencing, duplicates, unlicensed code systems, use-additional-code hints |
| Confidence | Platform score from evidence, retrieval, validation, entity match, model agreement and (low-weight) LLM self-report; weights and review threshold **fitted on a validation split**, not guessed |
| Review | Approve / edit (with KB search) / reject with reason + error category / add missed code / finalize / admin reopen. Only human coders can approve; integrations cannot |
| Traceability | `model_runs` record provider, model, prompt version, retrieval version, KB version, tokens, cost, latency. `reviews` record original vs. final code and error category |
| Security | JWT + RBAC (admin, coder, auditor, service), API keys (hashed), bcrypt, login rate limiting, Fernet encryption of all PHI columns and stored files with key rotation, hash-chained audit log with a DB trigger that forbids UPDATE/DELETE, PHI-free logs and webhooks, SSRF-safe callbacks, security headers, production config guard |
| Operations | Postgres job queue (`SKIP LOCKED`, retries, stale-lock recovery), horizontally scalable workers, Prometheus metrics, JSON logs with request IDs, health/readiness probes, Alembic migrations |
| Reference data | `kb load-all` loads the official CMS/CDC files as published: ICD-10-CM order/codes files (validity authority), ICD-10-PCS, HCPCS ANWEB fixed-width (+ modifiers, coverage codes, termination dates, processing notes), NCCI MUE, NCCI PTP, CPT CSV (licensed), fee schedule, LCD/NCD coverage crosswalk, Official Guidelines PDFs. Every set has a validity window; `kb freshness` warns before it expires |
| Procedures | CPT/HCPCS (outpatient) and ICD-10-PCS (inpatient) suggestions for procedures documented as performed; drug units inferred from documented dose |
| Guidelines RAG | ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines split into citable passages (`I.C.4.a`, `B3.1b`...), attached to each suggestion and given to the LLM |
| Claim scrubber | 30+ deterministic pre-bill rules with typical CARC/RARC, fix and source; risk score and dollars at risk (`POST /api/v1/claims/scrub`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/claim-check`, `python -m app.cli claims scrub`) |
| Workbench | AAXIS AI-branded web UI (custom HTML/CSS on Gradio, dark graphite + silver theme, mobile friendly) for Colab/pilots: code a note, scrub a claim, code lookup (with MUE/notes/Excludes), guideline search, reference-data status. **Download branded PDF reports** of coded notes, claim checks and code sheets |
| Evaluation | 4 baselines from the plan (LLM only → +RAG → +validation → full) plus a no-LLM retrieval baseline, precision/recall/F1, category F1, exact match, unsupported-code rate, retrieval recall, auto-accept precision, latency, cost, error taxonomy, threshold calibration |
| Automation | n8n workflows: document intake (webhook → upload → process → route → alert → respond) and platform events (HMAC-verified → finalized-code export / failure alerts) |

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
python scripts/setup_env.py           # creates .env with generated secrets; asks for your OpenRouter key
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f migrate         # wait for "knowledge base ready" (first run: 5-10 min)
```

First boot runs migrations, loads ICD-10-CM and builds the vector index (a few minutes). Then:

- Review UI: http://localhost:3000 (sign in with the admin email and password printed by `setup_env.py`)
- API docs (non-production): http://localhost:8000/docs
- n8n: http://localhost:5678

Create a coder and an integration key:

```bash
docker compose exec api python -m app.cli create-user coder@example.org --role coder
docker compose exec api python -m app.cli create-api-key n8n --role service
```

In n8n, create a **Header Auth** credential named `Medical Coding API key` (header `X-API-Key`, value = the key above), open the two imported workflows, select that credential on the HTTP nodes, and activate them. Documents can then be sent to `POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/clinical-document` (multipart field `file`).

Production: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` adds Caddy TLS termination and removes directly published ports. See [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## Local development

```bash
cd backend
pip install -e ".[dev,kb,embeddings]"
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://medcoding:medcoding@localhost:5432/medcoding
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.cli kb bootstrap            # load ICD-10-CM + build vector index
python -m app.cli create-user you@example.org --role admin
uvicorn app.main:app --reload             # API on :8000
python -m app.worker                      # background jobs

cd ../frontend && npm ci && BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev   # UI on :3000
```

Without an OpenRouter key, `LLM_PROVIDER=heuristic` runs the full pipeline with the deterministic retrieval-only coder, which is useful for development and as a baseline.

Load your reference files (see `data_sources/README.md`):

```bash
python -m app.cli kb load-all --data-dir ../data_sources [--i-have-a-cpt-license]
python -m app.cli kb index --system all
python -m app.cli kb freshness --dos 2026-10-01
python -m app.cli code-note ../data/sample_notes/01_office_visit_knee_injection.txt --sex M --age 67
python -m app.demo.gradio_app            # workbench UI on :7860
```

Tests: `cd backend && pytest` (80 tests; set `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` to also run the Postgres-specific tests).

## Evaluation

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.evaluation.runner --split dev --baselines all
python -m app.evaluation.runner --split validation --calibrate calibration.json   # fit weights + threshold
CALIBRATION_FILE=calibration.json python -m app.evaluation.runner --split test --out test-report.json
```

Claim scrubber: `python -m app.evaluation.claims_eval` (26 labeled claims, `data/evaluation/claims_scrub_cases.jsonl`).

Current results for the **no-LLM retrieval-only baseline** on the synthetic dataset (36 notes, 71 gold codes). The test split was run once, after all tuning was done on dev/validation:

| Split | Precision | Recall | F1 | Category F1 | Exact match | Unsupported codes | Retrieval recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dev (tuned on) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0% | 100% |
| validation | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.96 | 0.83 | 0% | 96% |
| **test (held out)** | **0.92** | **0.96** | **0.94** | 1.00 | 0.92 | 0% | 100% |

(Lexical-only retrieval, as in `docs/evaluation/test-report-retrieval-only-postfix.json`; unchanged by the procedure/claims release, so no regression. On Colab with BGE embeddings, re-run step 10 of the notebook to measure the hybrid configuration.)

LLM baselines need `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` and were not run in the build environment. Details, error analysis and the calibration procedure: [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md).
